# Traffic Light Detection AI
This project uses PyTorch to train an AI model capable of determining whether a given image contains a traffic light. It is trained on ~20,000 images from LISA Traffic Light Dataset. You can use my trained model to test images for the presence of traffic lights, or you can alter the code to train a model based on your own images.
